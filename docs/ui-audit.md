# Native UI design audit

Reference: the approved [interactive design](http://127.0.0.1:8770/capybara-camp-interactive.html).
The native app has **not passed the full design audit**. This is the working
discrepancy list, not a release approval.

## Review method

Use a separately identified native development app and synthetic provider
profiles. Leave the user's running sessions untouched. For each surface,
capture the reference and native view at matching window sizes, compare visual
details, click through its interactions, fix discrepancies, rebuild and repeat.
Check empty, loading, active, waiting, error and completed states. Record what
was actually verified; do not infer full parity from one screen or unit tests.

Compare glyph geometry and color, font size/weight, spacing, borders, backgrounds,
button/menu treatment, card dimensions, copy, focus, keyboard actions, pointer
targets, resizing and scrolling. The final pass repeats the entire inventory on
the release candidate after remaining capabilities are implemented.

## Findings and verification

| ID | Finding | Current evidence and next check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI-01 | Main chat and subagents were below Recent sessions | Corrected and clicked through in the native review build: main chat, Accessibility review, Layout review, back to main. Each shows its own transcript. Repeat with running children, empty children and session changes |
| UI-02 | Chat used a compact combined model menu where the design has labeled Model, Effort and Speed fields | Shared component now has compact and expanded presentations. All Claude aliases/versions were visible and a version change worked. Replaced custom chevrons with native menu indicators; pass 3 shows arrows after the values. Text alignment, narrow windows and all planning/implementation uses still need comparison |
| UI-03 | Native Claude glyph, Codex glyph and planning symbol differed from the reference | Updated cached native images from the approved vector paths and colors. Pass 3 shows the matching robot, terminal and bulb; intrinsic image sizes now remain small inside AppKit menus |
| UI-04 | Board status was below the subagents footer; design places it above that footer | Reordered within the existing uniform card. Pass 2 exposed bottom clipping. Pass 3 verifies ordinary and completed-comparison cards contain their footers after spacing/image-size fixes. Running/approval/queued states still need comparison |
| UI-05 | Native recent-session filter used an icon plus a detached value | Replaced with a labeled filter and visible count. Verified Codex filtering preserves the open Claude chat. Ten-item cap was visible before filtering; verify keyboard and small-window treatment |
| UI-06 | Board/Chat selection used a bright system-blue treatment | Changed to the reference's neutral segmented treatment. First native capture verified; recheck focus and keyboard semantics |
| UI-07 | Planning navigation and stage presentation differ from the reference | Open. Compare both-provider view, participant drill-down, reviews, combined plan, history and implementation in one flow |
| UI-08 | Memory, skills and cloud execution controls are in the design but not fully implemented natively | Open. Integrate the real services, then audit these screens; a placeholder does not pass |
| UI-09 | Quit did not take effect while Manage sources was open in earlier QA | Open. Reproduce and test all modal keyboard/close behavior |
| UI-10 | Message metadata, composer/context placement and notification styling need detailed comparison | Open. Long-transcript live append passed: 65 synthetic messages appeared without refresh and the latest marker remained visible. Still compare metadata, dictation, approvals, queues, toasts and notification navigation |
| UI-11 | Projects and new account onboarding need visual integration with the approved style | Open. Preserve the agreed project/account functionality while checking spacing, icons and shared control treatment |
| UI-12 | Remaining native segmented controls still use the system-blue treatment | Open. Projects, Sources, notification filtering and shared-plan stages need the same neutral segmented style as Board/Chat |

Local captures are in `build/ui-audit/`: `reference-chat.png`,
`reference-board.png`, `reference-planning.png`, `native-chat-before.png`, and
`native-chat-after.png`, `native-chat-pass3.png`, and `native-board-pass3.png`.
Captures are development evidence, not release demo
assets. Native captures use twelve synthetic sessions and two child transcripts;
no real provider credential or chat is required.

The signed development build passed after these changes. Focused native suites
passed for state/transcript notifications, local conversations and queues,
single/comparison planning, same-ticket implementation, and onboarding. Those
tests do not prove complete visual parity or the unimplemented cloud surfaces.

## Full inventory still to pass

- Board: each provider, single/comparison plans, implementation cards, all stages,
  long titles, model menus, context/history actions and consistent dimensions
- Chat: parent and children, ten recent sessions, filtering and @ discovery,
  model/settings, history pagination, live scrolling, dictation, steering,
  queues, permissions and approval/error states
- Planning: new single/comparison plan, both chats, participant drill-down,
  settings, context, cancellation, restart, budget, history, combined result and
  same-ticket implementation
- Sources/onboarding: automatic discovery, local profiles, cloud accounts,
  GitHub, projects, empty/loading/error/connected states, skip/resume and sign-out
- Multiplayer/execution: shared sessions, invitations, permissions, offline
  requests, Local/Cloud defaults/transfers, Git selection and publication
- Memory and skills: all tabs, scope/provider/account/model controls, provenance,
  consolidation and sync states, editing and conflicts
- Notifications: foreground toast, history/unread state, settings, native desktop
  notification and navigation to its result

Release acceptance also requires a final keyboard/accessibility, resize,
performance and memory-growth pass. Keep this audit open until all inventory
items have direct evidence and remaining defects are resolved.

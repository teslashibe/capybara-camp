# Native UI design audit

Reference: the approved [interactive design](http://127.0.0.1:8770/capybara-camp-interactive.html).
The native app has **not passed the full design audit**. This is the working
discrepancy list, not a release approval.

## Review method

Use a separately identified native development app and synthetic provider
profiles. Leave the user's running sessions untouched. For each surface,
capture the reference and native view at matching window sizes, compare visual
details, click through its interactions, fix discrepancies, rebuild and repeat.
Check empty, loading, active, waiting, error and completed states. Record what
was actually verified; do not infer full parity from one screen or unit tests.

Compare glyph geometry and color, font size/weight, spacing, borders, backgrounds,
button/menu treatment, card dimensions, copy, focus, keyboard actions, pointer
targets, resizing and scrolling. The final pass repeats the entire inventory on
the release candidate after remaining capabilities are implemented.

## Findings and verification

| ID | Finding | Current evidence and next check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI-01 | Main chat and subagents were below Recent sessions | Corrected and clicked through in the native review build: main chat, Accessibility review, Layout review, back to main. Each shows its own transcript. Repeat with running children, empty children and session changes |
| UI-02 | Chat used a compact combined model menu where the design has labeled Model, Effort and Speed fields | Shared component now has compact and expanded presentations. All Claude aliases/versions were visible and a version change worked. Replaced custom chevrons with native menu indicators. The final capture verifies proportional fields that fill the implementation row; narrow planner columns use two rows. Remaining account/source controls and shared execution still need comparison |
| UI-03 | Native Claude glyph, Codex glyph and planning symbol differed from the reference | Updated cached native images from the approved vector paths and colors. Pass 3 shows the matching robot, terminal and bulb; intrinsic image sizes now remain small inside AppKit menus |
| UI-04 | Board status was below the subagents footer; design places it above that footer | Reordered within the existing uniform card. Pass 2 exposed bottom clipping. Pass 3 verifies ordinary and completed-comparison cards contain their footers after spacing/image-size fixes. Running/approval/queued states still need comparison |
| UI-05 | Native recent-session filter used an icon plus a detached value | Replaced with a labeled filter and visible count. Verified Codex filtering preserves the open Claude chat. Ten-item cap was visible before filtering; verify keyboard and small-window treatment |
| UI-06 | Board/Chat selection used a bright system-blue treatment | Changed to the reference's neutral segmented treatment. First native capture verified; recheck focus and keyboard semantics |
| UI-07 | Planning navigation and stage presentation differ from the reference | Added the shared planning navigation, provider child tiles and stage bar. Native passes 4–6 verified both chats, provider drill-down, combined result, history and implementation on the same ticket. Combined result, history and implementation retain both conversations above their content. Restart retained version 1 and created editable version 2; switching that revision to single planning removed the second provider. A two-message session snapshot was attached through the picker. Shared-result and running states still need validation |
| UI-08 | Memory, skills and cloud execution controls are in the design but not fully implemented natively | Open. Integrate the real services, then audit these screens; a placeholder does not pass |
| UI-09 | Quit did not take effect while Manage sources was open in earlier QA | Corrected using AppKit's per-window termination setting and the existing save/delegate path. Audit 9 verified Command-Q from Sources, Projects and Notifications, actual process exit, helper exit, and reopening the saved five-step plan. Remaining sheets and interrupted/in-flight operations still belong to the final keyboard audit |
| UI-10 | Message metadata, composer/context placement and notification styling need detailed comparison | Planner responses now show the recorded provider/model/effort/speed through the shared message component; pass 7 verified the full-width and wrapped headers. Long-transcript live append also passed: 65 synthetic messages appeared without refresh and the latest marker remained visible. Still compare main-chat metadata, dictation, approvals, queues, toasts and notification navigation |
| UI-11 | Projects and new account onboarding need visual integration with the approved style | Open. Preserve the agreed project/account functionality while checking spacing, icons and shared control treatment |
| UI-12 | Remaining native segmented controls still use the system-blue treatment | Projects, Sources, notifications and Board/Chat now share one neutral segmented component. Native pass 6 verified distinct Local profiles, Cloud accounts and GitHub accessible names and successful source-tab switching. Full keyboard navigation and other sheets remain open |
| UI-13 | Implementation's shorter planning panes allowed text to spill into the adjacent provider | Pass 5 verifies transcript wrapping inside both columns after constraining each scroll viewport's content width. Bottom-following is preserved; repeat at the minimum window size |
| UI-14 | Completed planning stages were all reported as selected to accessibility | Native passes 6 and 9 verify button roles, correct selection/completion values and the unavailable description. The unfinished Implementation control is disabled and refuses activation |
| UI-15 | Resizing a planning pane can leave the latest lines below its scroll position | Pass 7 verifies that both planner transcripts follow the bottom after narrowing the window. Model controls and response metadata wrap without overlapping, and the final line stays visible. The size-bound task cancels when the viewport disappears or resizes again |

Local captures are in `build/ui-audit/`: `reference-chat.png`,

`native-planning-verified.png`, `native-implementation-verified.png`,
`native-implementation-final.png`, and `native-implementation-narrow-final.png`.
Captures are development evidence, not release demo
assets. Native captures use twelve synthetic sessions and two child transcripts;
no real provider credential or chat is required.

The signed development build passed after these changes. Focused native suites
passed for state/transcript notifications, local conversations and queues,
single/comparison planning, same-ticket implementation, and onboarding. Those
tests do not prove complete visual parity or the unimplemented cloud surfaces.
The latest focused run also passed shared planning, project persistence and
notification recovery. Audit 9 checked switching from a focused Claude planner
to a single Codex plan without losing the visible pane.

The final development build for this pass is
`build/Capybara Camp UI Review Current.app`, with a separate bundle identity and
synthetic profile/support directories. The final field-width adjustment passed
compilation, signing verification and native wide/narrow screen checks. No
release or production app replacement was performed.

## Full inventory still to pass

- Board: each provider, single/comparison plans, implementation cards, all stages,
  long titles, model menus, context/history actions and consistent dimensions
- Chat: parent and children, ten recent sessions, filtering and @ discovery,
  model/settings, history pagination, live scrolling, dictation, steering,
  queues, permissions and approval/error states
- Planning: new single/comparison plan, both chats, participant drill-down,
  settings, context, cancellation, restart, budget, history, combined result and
  same-ticket implementation
- Sources/onboarding: automatic discovery, local profiles, cloud accounts,
  GitHub, projects, empty/loading/error/connected states, skip/resume and sign-out
- Multiplayer/execution: shared sessions, invitations, permissions, offline
  requests, Local/Cloud defaults/transfers, Git selection and publication
- Memory and skills: all tabs, scope/provider/account/model controls, provenance,
  consolidation and sync states, editing and conflicts
- Notifications: foreground toast, history/unread state, settings, native desktop
  notification and navigation to its result

Release acceptance also requires a final keyboard/accessibility, resize,
performance and memory-growth pass. Keep this audit open until all inventory
items have direct evidence and remaining defects are resolved.

AppKit's [modal-window termination setting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/preventsapplicationterminationwhenmodal)
documents the default refusal before consulting the app delegate. The native
window modifier applies the setting only to Camp's views and sheets, and enables
automatic keyboard-view ordering. Persistence still uses the existing deferred
termination path. Development-only opt-in lifecycle logs contain stage names,
not session data.
